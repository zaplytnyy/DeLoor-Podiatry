This technique is proven to be especially effective in treating chronic problems, and not just plantar fasciitis and heel pain. Patients with Achilles tendinopathy – swelling and stiffness of the Achilles tendon – are also frequently recommended to try this therapy.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h3>Custom Foot Arch Support:</h3>\n          <h4>Price - $99.00</h4>\n          <p>\n          Description: Custom arch supports put the feet back into proper alignment and allow them to function like they were meant to. When the feet are aligned correctly, the stress on ligaments, tendons, and joints disappears. Whether it’s a teenager, an athlete, a businessman, or a senior lady working in retail, wearing custom arch supports consistently can relieve their foot pain.          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h3>Toenail Fungus Laser Treatment:</h3>\n          <h4>Price - $99.00</h4>\n          <p>\n          Description: Have you noticed a yellow discoloration in one or more of your toenails? Is the toenail thicker and harder to trim than usual? Perhaps white marks have appeared under the nail plate, and you’re detecting an unpleasant odor. Well, chances are you have the ever-annoying Toenail Fungus.          </p>\n          <p>Our patients have experienced promising results with our FDA-approved laser treatments. In fact, many find their toenails are clear 12 months after a single treatment. And unlike topical or oral antifungal medications, there are no side effects or medication interaction concerns.</p>\n          <hr />\n          <h3>Toenail restoration:</h3>\n          <h4>Price - $225.00</h4>\n          <p>\n          Description: Fungus or trauma may lead to partial or full toenail removal. Sometimes, that’s not only the problem itself but also a single option to treat it. This is not necessarily the last step of the treatment plan though. The next one should be resolving the cosmetic issue. Especially when painless, fast, and efficient solutions are available.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n          Modern techniques of toenail restoration allow doctors to remodel damaged nails. The composite resin they apply helps to create a flexible and durable cosmetic nail that does not impede your natural nail to grow.\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <h3>DeLoor Podiatry Imaging:</h3>\n          <h4>Prices:</h4>\n          <h4>Foot/ankle X-Ray - $99.00</h4>\n          <h4>Foot/ankle CT Scan* - $299.00 </h4>\n          <h4>Foot/ankle MRI* -  $399.00</h4>\n          <h4>$99.00 additional doctor's consultation</h4>\n          <h5>*CT and  MRI scannings are available only in Manhattan.</h5>   \n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </article>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n"],"names":["fullMenu","id","className"],"sourceRoot":""}
